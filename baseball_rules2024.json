A league by its own action may limit the number \nof preparatory pitches and/or may limit the amount of time such \npreparatory pitches may consume. If a sudden emergency causes a \npitcher to be summoned into the game without any opportunity to \nwarm up, the umpire-in-chief shall allow him as many pitches as the \numpire deems necessary.\n(c)  Pitcher Delays\nWhen the bases are unoccupied, the pitcher shall deliver the ball to \nthe batter within 12 seconds after he receives the ball. Each time \nthe pitcher delays the game by violating this rule, the umpire shall \ncall “Ball.”\nThe 12-second timing starts when the pitcher is in possession of the \nball and the batter is in the box, alert to the pitcher. The timing stops \nwhen the pitcher releases the ball.\nThe intent of this rule is to avoid unnecessary delays. The umpire \nshall insist that the catcher return the ball promptly to the pitcher, \nand that the pitcher take his position on the rubber promptly. \nObvious delay by the pitcher should instantly be penalized by the \numpire.\n"

(B) When \nthe ball is dead, no runner may return to touch a missed base \nor one he has left after he has advanced to and touched a base \nbeyond the missed base.\nRule 5.09(c)(2) Comment:\nPLAY—(A) Batter hits ball out of park or ground rule double \nand misses first base (ball is dead)—he may return to first \nbase to correct his mistake before he touches second but if \nhe touches second he may not return to first and if defensive \nteam appeals he is declared out at first.\n"

It is not a catch, however, if simultaneously \nor immediately following his contact with the ball, he collides with \na player, or with a wall, or if he falls down, and as a result of such \ncollision or falling, drops the ball. It is not a catch if a fielder touches a \nfly ball which then hits a member of the offensive team or an umpire and \nthen is caught by another defensive player. In establishing the validity \nof the catch, the fielder shall hold the ball long enough to prove that \nhe has complete control of the ball and that his release of the ball is \nvoluntary and intentional. If the fielder has made the catch and drops \nthe ball while in the act of making a throw following the catch, the ball \nshall be adjudged to have been caught.\n(Catch) Comment: A catch is legal if the ball is finally held \nby any fielder, even though juggled, or held by another fielder \nbefore it touches the ground. Runners may leave their bases the \ninstant the first fielder touches the ball. A fielder may reach over \na fence, railing, rope or other line of demarcation to make a \ncatch. He may jump on top of a railing, or canvas that may be in \nfoul ground. No interference should be allowed when a fielder \nreaches over a fence, railing, rope or into a stand to catch a ball. \nHe does so at his own risk.\nIf a fielder, attempting a catch at the edge of the dugout, is “held \nup” and kept from an apparent fall by a player or players of \neither team and the catch is made, it shall be allowed.\nThe CATCHER is the fielder who takes his position back of the \nhome base.\nThe CATCHER’S BOX is that area within which the catcher shall \nstand until the pitcher delivers the ball.\n"

Example: Man on first, one out, ball hit \nsharply to first baseman who touches the bag and batter-runner is \nout. The force is removed at that moment and runner advancing \nto second must be tagged. If there had been a runner on third or \nsecond, and either of these runners scored before the tag-out at \nsecond, the run counts. Had the first baseman thrown to second \nand the ball then had been returned to first, the play at second \nwas a force out, making two outs, and the return throw to first \nahead of the runner would have made three outs. In that case, no \nrun would score.\nExample: Not a force out. One out. Runner on first and third. \nBatter flies out. Two out. Runner on third tags up and scores. \nRunner on first tries to retouch before throw from fielder reaches \nfirst baseman, but does not get back in time and is out. Three \nouts.

The umpire must rule also that a ball is an \ninfield fly, even if handled by an outfielder, if, in the umpire’s \njudgment, the ball could have been as easily handled by an \ninfielder.
